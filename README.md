## 01. Brief
Focus your brief
What is it?
Who is it for?
What will it do?

### Task
*Write a Brief for your Portfolio Design.*<br>
A brief for yourself. “Easy”, eh…

It should be:
A single page brief with a blurb defining what the site will be, what content is needed and who the website is targeted at. Keep in mind the needs of your target audience. You should be able to hand this brief to anyone and they’d have a decent grasp of what you’re trying to achieve.

### Task
*Wireframe your Website*
Use the research you’ve collected and keep your brief close by for reference. Use what we’ve covered to sketch out your website with pen & paper. Be sure to break your site up into different pages like ‘About’, ‘Projects’, etc. Do wireframes for each of these page that present its content in the best light. These wireframes are what we’ll use to work up our code.
